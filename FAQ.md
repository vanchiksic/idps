# FAQ #

## What do i need to run this application? ##

You need to have the Java Runtime Environment installed (JRE). You can download it at http://www.java.com/. You need Java 6 (aka 1.6) or later to run this application without problems.


## How do i start it? ##

Usually doubleclicking is enough. If it's not, you maybe do not have Java installed properly.


## I have Java installed, but doubleclicking doesn't work ##

Sometimes the jar extension does not get properly assigned to Java (or some other programs steal it like WinZip). Then you can try "Open With" -> java.exe or try this quick fix:

## I can not get it to start ##

Start it from he command line to see what error messages you are getting. Open the command prompt/console and change directory to the folder where the iDPS jar is located. Then type "java -jar iDPSvXrX.jar" (fill in the proper version numbers). Then open a ticket here with a report & the error message you are getting.


## It doesn't seem to work properly ##

You need Java RE 6. Download the latest Java RE if your version is outdated.


## Where can i report Bugs? ##

Please use the "Issues" feature of this site at the top. Bug reports in coments on the wiki pages will most likely be ignored and deleted.


## My item X is missing ##

I generally only added items with item level 232+. Only exceptions are very common/popular/easy to obtain items like DMC:G, Mjolnir Runstone, Badge Items etc.


## How can I add item X? ##

Rename the file from .jar to .zip. Decompress the archive. Look for a file names items.xml. Add your item. Save the file. Zip the folder again and rename it to .jar. If you did everything right it should work, if you did something wrong the application will most likely not start.


## How can I enchant my items? ##

Right click them.


## My profession specific Enchant/Gem is missing ##

Enable that profession in the menu bar.


## What poisons is iDPS using? ##

Instant Poison in your slow weapon, Deadly in the fast one. If they have the same speed, Deadly is used in the Main Hand.

## It is showing different stats then my paper doll ##

Make sure all of your items/gems are in iDPS. If they aren't included, thei stats won't be added. Also make sure you have the right talents and professions selected. iDPS only imports your items and enchants, not your professions and/or talents.


## It is showing a different crit rate then my paper doll ##

iDPS shows your crit% vs a L83 target, which is 4.8% lower then your paper doll.
