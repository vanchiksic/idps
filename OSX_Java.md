## OSX and Java ##

Generally Java should already be preinstalled on OSX, but it might be an outdated version. On OSX you download Java from Apple and not from the official Java website. On the latest versions of OSX you should be able to get Java Updates to JRE6 through the OS System update. Otherwise you can manually download it on Apple support.

This application needs Java 6. However Java 6 is not running on all releases of OSX. Here is a short overview:
  * 10.4 Tiger: No Java 6
  * 10.5 Leopard: Java 6 only on Intel Macs as a System Update
  * 10.6 Snow Leopard: Java 6 Preinstalled

Yes this means if you are using a PPC Mac there is nothing you can do to get this application to work, except buying a new computer.

## Java Download ##

For Intel Macs running 10.5 you can get an update to JRE6 here, tho I suggest using the system update service.

## Switching preferred Java Version ##

You need to set your preferred Java Version to JRE6. Run Applications -> Utilities and set the preferred Java version to Java SE 6.
